Project Overview:- 

This project analyzes daily global stock market data from 2020 to 2024 to uncover trends in market performance, volatility, and regional behavior across major stock indices.

Using Python for data preprocessing and exploratory analysis, PostgreSQL for advanced SQL-based analytics, and Power BI for interactive visualization, the project provides insights into risk patterns, seasonal performance trends, and long-term market behavior.

The final deliverable is a dynamic dashboard that enables users to explore market performance, compare risk levels across regions, and support data-driven investment analysis.
